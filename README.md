# Unbury Your Gays

## Summary

This app is a mini-database of queer (particularly female-identifying) movies and tv shows. The intent of the app is to allow users to browse titles they may not have heard of, and to search for movies and tv shows by their genre, language, actors involved, and others. Each title can be investigated further and the official trailer is provided within the app. Additionally, there is a suggestion box so that users can suggest their favorite movies and show if they don't find them in the current database.

## Explaining the name

For those of you who may be less familiar with queer slang and lingo, the phrase "bury your gays" refers to the practice of killing off the gay character in a movie or tv show. The title Unbury Your Gays alerts the user that the nature of the content will be queer media (movies, tv shows, etc.) and flips a common phrase on it's head.
